## Abstract

  <h3>Motivation: </h3>
<pre>  Water is vital for life and the well-being of our communities, yet rapid population growth and urbanization pose 
  significant challenges to its management. The increasing demand for clean water and effective sewage treatment 
  necessitates a coordinated approach to resource oversight. Establishing a District Sewage and Water Board is essential 
  for ensuring efficient water distribution, proper sewage management, and adherence to environmental standards. By 
  centralizing these responsibilities, we can improve service delivery, promote sustainable practices, and safeguard 
  public health. A proactive approach to managing water resources will not only enhance community resilience but also 
  foster a healthier environment for current and future generations.</pre>
  <h3>Problem Statement: </h3>
<pre>  As urbanization and population density increase, effective management of water resources and sewage systems has 
  become a critical challenge for communities. Inadequate oversight can lead to inefficient water distribution, inadequate 
  sewage treatment, and negative environmental impacts, jeopardizing public health and sustainability. The absence of a 
  centralized authority hampers planning and infrastructure development, resulting in unreliable access to clean water and 
  waste management services. To address these issues, a District Sewage and Water Board is needed to streamline operations, 
  enhance service delivery, and ensure that all residents benefit from efficient, sustainable water and sewage management 
  systems.</pre>
  <h3> Features:</h3><pre>
  1. Water is collectively stored in Water Reservoir from where the City and the Town receive Water.
  2. Treatment of Sewage Water from the City and Town:
     a. The Sewage from the Town & City Directly goes to the Water Treatment Board
     b. The Treated Water then is sent to the City's Water Reservoir
  3. City & Town Water Management with Dynamic Population Variation:
     a. Town and City's population can be dynamically altered using User's input affecting the Water Intake and Sewage 
        Production
     b. This in turn alters the Load on Water Treatment and Reservoir</pre>

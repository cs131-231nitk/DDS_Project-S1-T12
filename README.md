## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Know More</summary>
   In a generation of advanced development, and wireless technologies, the scope for secure transmission of data and prevention of intercepting data is growing with time. This calls for the ability to control and conquer the analyzation of the frequency bandwidth range for better encryption settlement, and study frequency operations & their impact on system performance. The ability to encrypt messages such that restricted authoritarians have access, disrupting all the other possible incoming disturbances. Therefore, by disrupting transmission and modulation, secure zones can be created where only authorized communication is possible. <br>
   Implementing wave disruptors to control communication can be utilized in certain areas during certain Law operations in the notion of reduced coordination within the group. And, in environments where multiple communication devices operate on the same frequency, a disruptor can also be used to study frequency congestion and its impact on system performance. This enables the development of better strategies for frequency transmission and management. This defines the equipment of the disruptor to be capable of operating across different frequency bands allowing it to focus on disrupting only certain types of signals while leaving others unaffected. The disruptor will be able to operate on multiple different frequency bands to disrupt these diverse communication protocols at the same time by interference having the ability to detect active frequencies and modulations in real-time, offering feedback on the strength and type of signal being transmitted.

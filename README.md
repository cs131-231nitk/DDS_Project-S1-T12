## Abstract

  <summary>Know More</summary>
  <h3>Introduction: </h3>
<pre>  Water is an essential resource that sustains life and supports our communities. However, with increasing population 
  density and urbanization, effective management of sewage and water resources has become a pressing challenge. A District 
  Sewage and Water Board is crucial for overseeing water distribution, ensuring efficient sewage treatment, and maintaining 
  environmental standards. By centralizing these responsibilities, we can enhance service delivery, promote sustainability, 
  and protect public health.</pre>
  <h3>Description: </h3>
<pre>  This Model of District Sewage and Water Management board can oversee the efficient distribution of clean water and 
  the treatment of sewage. This will enable better planning and infrastructure development, ensuring that our communities 
  have reliable access to clean water and effective waste management systems. By streamlining these functions, it can 
  ensure reliable access to essential services for all residents.</pre>
  <h3> Features:</h3><pre>
  1. Water collection from Rain and Other Sources are collectively stored in the source of the Water Reservoir from 
     where the City and the Town receive Water.
  2. Treatment of Sewage Water from the City and Town:
     a. The Sewage from the Town & City Directly goes to the Water Treatment Board
     b. The Treated Water then is sent to the City's Water Reservoir
  3. City & Town Water Management with Dynamic Population Variation:
     a. Town and City's population can be dynamically altered using User's input affecting the Water Intake and Sewage 
        Production
     b. This in turn alters the Load on Water Treatment and Reservoir</pre>
